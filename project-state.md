# ape-kingdom — Project State

> Current state and progress. Updated by the auto-pi loop as work is done.

## Status

**M1, M2 complete; M3 in progress** — Foundation (guidelines, core scaffold, CI, Pages) and the full core game engine (all rules reducers) are done; the AI opponent / Human vs AI game loop is the current milestone.

## What's here

- Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind project scaffold.
- Core/UI split with `src/core` (business logic) and `src/ui` (thin views).
- Vitest with 100% coverage enforced on `src/core/**/*.ts`.
- `/guidelines` folder with the Ape Kingdom game rules and web implementation guidelines (theme, atomic design, context injection), referenced from README/manifest.
- Core entity model in `src/core/game.ts`: ape units (4 ranks), sites (Grove/Nest/Home Tree), players, hex map, static data tables (cost/rank/movement/income), and helpers (create unit/site/player, standard two-player setup). 100% core coverage.
- Full rules engine implemented as pure reducers in `src/core/game.ts`: `collectIncome` (M2-T1), `recruitUnit` (M2-T2), `moveUnit` (M2-T3), `attackUnit` (M2-T4), `eliminatePlayers` (M2-T5), `resolveVictory`/`checkVictory` (M2-T6). All reject illegal actions with typed errors and are 100% core covered.
- AI opponent and game loop in `src/core`: `ai.ts` (M3-T2) enumerates legal actions and selects a deterministic, rule-legal move; `gameLoop.ts` (M3-T3) wires the full Human vs AI turn cycle via `playTurn` (human moves -> AI reply -> turn advance), enforcing turn-step ordering and skipping eliminated players, with full-game simulation tests proving games complete with a winner and the AI never makes an illegal move. 100% core covered.
- CI (lint + test:coverage + build) green on `main`.
- GitHub Pages enabled (build via GitHub Actions) and the live demo is deployed: https://AntonLapshin.github.io/ape-kingdom/

## Next steps
